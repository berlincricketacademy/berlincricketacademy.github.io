Berlin Cricket Academy is all about "Developing Talent & Enhancing
Performance". We aim to create a platform and environment from which
cricket becomes one of the most accessible sports for women & youth at
grassroots level in Germany. Berlin Cricket Academy aims to create unforgettable and empowering
sporting experiences for females and youths of all ages, abilities and
backgrounds. Berlin Cricket Academy aspires to be the go-to coaching initiative for all female
and youth players and coaches within the game and beyond, building
confidence and forging lasting friendships both on and off the field.
